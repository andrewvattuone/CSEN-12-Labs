 * Description: This file contains the public and private function and type
 *              definitions for a set abstract data type for generic
 *              pointer types.  A set is an unordered collection of unique
 *              elements.
 *
 *              This implementation uses a hash table to store the
 *              elements, with linear probing to resolve collisions.
 *              Insertion, deletion, and membership checks are all average
 *              case constant time.
 *
 *              Also contains a function that returns a sorted version of the queue in ascending order, which is performed using quicksort.
